# RAGline Daily Status

## Current Sprint: Day 2 - 2025-08-26

### 🎯 Today's Goals

- Implement core CRUD operations with caching
- Establish event streaming pipeline
- Create integration tests for cross-service communication
- Begin observability implementation

---

## 📋 Agent A (Core API & Data)

**Branch:** `feat/core-api`
**Focus:** Product CRUD, Redis caching, idempotency

### Tasks

- [ ] Product CRUD operations
  - [ ] GET /v1/products - list with pagination and filters
  - [ ] GET /v1/products/{id} - single product with cache-aside
  - [ ] POST /v1/products - create with validation
  - [ ] PUT /v1/products/{id} - update with cache invalidation
- [ ] Redis caching implementation
  - [ ] Create `packages/cache/redis_cache.py`
  - [ ] Implement cache-aside pattern with TTL jitter
  - [ ] Add stampede protection with distributed locks
- [ ] Order idempotency
  - [ ] POST /v1/orders with Idempotency-Key header
  - [ ] Implement UPSERT pattern for duplicate requests
  - [ ] Store response in orders.response_json

**Progress:** 0/3 main tasks (0%)
**Blockers:** None
**Notes:** Cache key pattern: ragline:{tenant_id}:product:{id}

## 📋 Agent B (Reliability & Events)

**Branch:** `feat/reliability`
**Focus:** Outbox consumer, SSE/WS notifier

### Tasks

- [ ] Outbox consumer daemon
  - [ ] Start consumer task with Celery beat
  - [ ] Process outbox entries to Redis streams
  - [ ] Update processed_at timestamps
- [ ] SSE/WebSocket notifier
  - [ ] Create `services/worker/tasks/notifications.py`
  - [ ] Subscribe to Redis streams
  - [ ] Fan-out to connected SSE/WS clients
- [ ] Integration testing
  - [ ] Test outbox → stream → notifier pipeline
  - [ ] Verify event ordering guarantees
  - [ ] Load test with multiple consumers

**Progress:** 0/3 main tasks (0%)
**Blockers:** Needs database running for outbox table
**Notes:** Stream key: ragline:stream:orders

---

## 📋 Agent C (LLM & RAG)

**Branch:** `feat/llm`
**Focus:** Streaming chat, RAG data ingestion

### Tasks

- [ ] Streaming chat improvements
  - [ ] Enhance SSE streaming with proper buffering
  - [ ] Add conversation memory management
  - [ ] Implement token counting and limits
- [ ] RAG data ingestion
  - [ ] Set up pgvector tables (coordinate with Agent A)
  - [ ] Ingest sample menu items with embeddings
  - [ ] Test similarity search queries
- [ ] Tool-RAG integration
  - [ ] Connect retrieve_menu tool to RAG search
  - [ ] Add context to tool responses
  - [ ] Implement relevance scoring

**Progress:** 0/3 main tasks (0%)
**Blockers:** Needs pgvector extension in database
**Notes:** Embedding dimension: 1536 (OpenAI)

## 🔄 Integration Checkpoints

| Time  | Checkpoint     | Status     | Details                                 |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 09:00 | Database Setup | ⏳ Pending | Ensure PostgreSQL with pgvector running |
| 11:00 | Cache Testing  | ⏳ Pending | Agent A demonstrates caching            |
| 14:00 | Event Flow     | ⏳ Pending | Agent B shows outbox → stream flow      |
| 16:00 | RAG Demo       | ⏳ Pending | Agent C demonstrates vector search      |
| 18:00 | Daily Merge    | ⏳ Pending | Merge and integration test              |

---

## 📊 Overall Progress

**Total Tasks:** 0/9 completed (0%)
**On Track:** ✅ Yes
**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low

---

## 🚧 Active Blockers

- Database with pgvector needed for full testing

---

## 📝 Decisions Made

1. Cache TTL: 5 minutes with 0-60s jitter
2. Idempotency window: 24 hours
3. Stream consumer group: ragline-notifier-group
4. Embedding model: text-embedding-3-small

---

## 🔮 Tomorrow's Priority (Day 3)

- **Agent A:** Order creation with idempotency, SSE endpoints
- **Agent B:** Outbox → Streams pipeline testing
- **Agent C:** Tool calling framework completion

---

## 📌 Important Notes

- Day 1 complete: All foundational components ready
- Database setup critical for Day 2 progress
- Integration testing becomes priority
