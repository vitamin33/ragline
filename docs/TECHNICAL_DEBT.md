# Technical Debt - Production Readiness

## Overview
This document tracks production readiness concerns identified during the development of the RAG system. These items should be addressed before production deployment.

## PostgreSQL + pgvector Production Concerns

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Address Before Production)

#### 1. Backup Strategy for Vector Data
- **Issue**: No backup/restore strategy for embeddings and vector data
- **Impact**: Data loss risk, no disaster recovery
- **Effort**: Medium (1-2 sprints)
- **Requirements**:
  - Automated daily backups of PostgreSQL with pgvector data
  - Point-in-time recovery capability
  - Backup validation and restore testing
  - Consider vector-specific backup optimizations
- **Owner**: DevOps/Platform team

#### 2. Tenant Isolation at Database Level
- **Issue**: Current multi-tenancy uses metadata filtering, not database-level isolation
- **Impact**: Potential data leakage, performance issues with large datasets
- **Effort**: Large (3-4 sprints)
- **Options**:
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) with tenant policies
  - Schema-per-tenant approach
  - Separate databases per tenant
- **Owner**: Architecture team

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (Performance & Reliability)

#### 3. Vector Index Performance Monitoring
- **Issue**: No monitoring of IVFFlat index performance and optimization
- **Impact**: Query performance degradation as data grows
- **Effort**: Small (1 sprint)
- **Requirements**:
  - Index usage statistics
  - Query plan analysis
  - Index maintenance automation (REINDEX, ANALYZE)
  - IVFFlat lists parameter tuning
- **Owner**: Agent B (Monitoring integration)

#### 4. Capacity Planning for Vector Growth
- **Issue**: No capacity planning or scaling strategy for vector storage
- **Impact**: Performance degradation, storage issues
- **Effort**: Medium (2 sprints)
- **Requirements**:
  - Storage growth projections
  - Query performance benchmarks at scale
  - Index size vs performance analysis
  - Auto-scaling strategies
- **Owner**: Platform team

### ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority (Operational Excellence)

#### 5. Query Optimization & Connection Management
- **Status**: âœ… **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- **Completed**:
  - Prepared statement patterns implemented
  - Basic connection pooling configured
- **Remaining**:
  - Query hint optimization for complex searches
  - Connection pool sizing based on load testing
  - Prepared statement caching strategies
- **Effort**: Small (remaining work)
- **Owner**: Agent C

## Monitoring & Observability Gaps

### Database Metrics (Agent B Scope)
- [ ] Query execution time percentiles
- [ ] Connection pool utilization
- [ ] Index hit ratios and efficiency
- [ ] Vector similarity search performance

### Application Metrics (Agent B Scope)
- [ ] Embedding generation latency
- [ ] RAG retrieval accuracy
- [ ] Cache hit rates for frequent queries
- [ ] Error rates and failure modes

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encryption at rest for vector embeddings
- [ ] Encryption in transit for all database connections
- [ ] Access logging and audit trails
- [ ] Sensitive data handling in embeddings

### Network Security
- [ ] Database network isolation
- [ ] Connection string security (secrets management)
- [ ] VPC/firewall configuration

## Testing Gaps

### Load Testing
- [ ] Concurrent similarity search performance
- [ ] Large dataset ingestion performance
- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Connection pool behavior under stress

### Failure Scenarios
- [ ] Database failover testing
- [ ] Connection pool exhaustion recovery
- [ ] Large query timeout handling
- [ ] Disk space exhaustion scenarios

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Pre-Production)
1. Backup strategy implementation
2. Basic monitoring integration (Agent B)
3. Security hardening

### Phase 2 (Production Optimization)
1. Tenant isolation strategy
2. Comprehensive load testing
3. Capacity planning

### Phase 3 (Scaling & Advanced)
1. Advanced monitoring and alerting
2. Auto-scaling implementation
3. Performance optimization

## Notes

- **Current Status**: Development/Learning phase - core functionality working
- **Production Readiness**: ~70% complete
- **Recommended Timeline**: Address Phase 1 items before production deployment
- **Dependencies**: Agent B monitoring tasks, DevOps pipeline setup
